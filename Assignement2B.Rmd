# Approach

In this assignment, I will analyze the performance of a binary classification model predicting penguin sex.  

The workflow will be as follows:

1. **Load the data**: I will download the raw CSV file from GitHub and load it into R.  
2. **Install and load required libraries**: Necessary libraries such as `ggplot2` and `dplyr` will be used for visualization and data manipulation.  
3. **Compute the null error rate**: This baseline metric shows the error if we always predict the majority class.  
4. **Visualize class distribution**: A plot will provide insight into the balance of the dataset and help interpret the null error rate.  
5. **Compute confusion matrices**: I will calculate TP, FP, TN, and FN at multiple probability thresholds.  
6. **Calculate performance metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be computed for each threshold.  
7. **Discuss threshold use cases**: I will describe scenarios where different thresholds are preferable.
