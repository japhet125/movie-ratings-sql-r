# Approach

My approach to this assignment is as follows:

First, I will select six recent movies. The movies I chose are:

1. Avatar: The Way of Water  
2. Avengers: Endgame  
3. Inside Out 2  
4. Top Gun: Maverick  
5. The Lion King  
6. Spider-Man: No Way Home  

How did I choose these movies? I used a language model (LLM) to identify some of the most popular recent films.  

Next, I will ask five people to rate each of these movies on a scale of 1–5.  

Using the collected information, I will create tables in PostgreSQL and insert all the relevant data.  

After that, I will connect the database to RStudio and use the `tidyverse` packages to query and analyze the data. I will also handle any missing ratings appropriately during the analysis.
